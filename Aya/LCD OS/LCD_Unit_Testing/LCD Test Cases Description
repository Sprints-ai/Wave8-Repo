/* LCD_Init */  
1- First test case is to check the happy scenario of the function.
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	- Actual   -> the program returns "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	
2- Second test case is to check the behavior of the function if DIO went wrong.
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function could detect that the Function Could detect that there's something went wrong in the layer below.
	- Actual   -> the program returns  "Passed" that's means the function could detect that DIO not working well.

/* LCD_SendCommand */  
1- First test case is to check the happy scenario of the function by inserting correct values for it's arguments
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	- Actual   -> the program returns "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	
2- Second test case is to trying send without initializing the LCD
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function could detect that LCD is not Initialized.
	- Actual   -> the program returns  "Passed" that's means the function could detect that LCD is not Initialized.

/* LCD_DisplayCharacter */  
1- First test case is to check the happy scenario of the function by inserting correct values for it's arguments
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	- Actual   -> the program returns "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	
2- Second test case is to trying send character without initializing the LCD
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function could detect that LCD is not Initialized.
	- Actual   -> the program returns  "Passed" that's means the function could detect that LCD is not Initialized.

3- Third test case is to insert a NULL character to Function 
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function could detect that it's a NULL character.
	- Actual   -> the program returns  "Passed" that's means the function could detect that it's a NULL character which is an invalid Parameter.

/* LCD_DisplayString */  
1- First test case is to check the happy scenario of the function by inserting correct values for it's arguments
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	- Actual   -> the program returns "Passed" that's means the function doing very well.
	
2- Second test case is to trying display string without initializing the LCD
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function could detect that LCD is not Initialized.
	- Actual   -> the program returns  "Passed" that's means the function could detect that LCD is not Initialized.

3- Third test case is to insert a NULL poininter 
    - Expected -> to return "Passed" that's means the function could detect that it's a NULL pointer.
	- Actual   -> the program returns  "Passed" that's means the function could detect that it's a NULL pointer.
